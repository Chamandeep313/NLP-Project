# NLP-Project
NLP project analyzing text with NLTK and Naive Bayes sentiment model.

This project demonstrates Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques using Python and the NLTK library. The analysis includes text preprocessing, frequency analysis, sentiment analysis, and word cloud visualization. Additionally, a Naive Bayes machine learning model is implemented to predict sentiment in movie reviews.

The project uses:

Project Gutenberg text (e.g., Emma by Jane Austen) for NLP analysis

NLTK movie reviews dataset for sentiment classification
